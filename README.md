learning github


Hello, 

My name is Matt Ashman - and I'm learning how to program. 

By learning how to utilize Github, I will be showing off my development, and the mind-set behind that development - so others can view, correct, and help me become a better developer. 

My goal is to be proficient in MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js; and.... to get a job as a developer one day. 

I have a lot of work to do, so I should probably stop typing, and get back to work!
